# Obsidian Plugin: Bookmark Line with Hotkeys

### Inspired by PyCharm (JetBrains IDE)

What it does:
By using `Ctrl + <1..9>` set up the bookmarks on any line of a file and move across all of your bookmarks with these.

Right panel includes the list of the Line-Bookmarks.

## Keybinding setup

1. Open **Settings → Hotkeys**.
2. Search for “Bookmark Line with Hotkeys”.
3. Reassign the hotkeys you want:
   - Set `Ctrl + Shift + <1..9>` (or another shortcut you prefer) for **Set bookmark <n>** (n is a number).
   - Set `Ctrl + <1..9>` for **Jump to bookmark <n>** (n is a number).
4. Obsidian warns if a shortcut is already in use—choose “Overwrite” or pick an alternative if you rely on the existing binding.
5. Repeat for each slot you plan to use.

> Tip: The plugin toggles a bookmark when you set the same slot twice in the same place. You can quickly clear a bookmark either from the sidebar “×” button or by pressing its slot shortcut again on the same line.

PS: I truly believe that if you have set Line-Bookmarks you don't need old Ctrl + <1..9> bindings for the tabs switching. Cheers ❤️
